TODO:

    - Simulate install option.
    - Download only implementation.

BUGS:

    - While self parsing program code formatting will be broken, only output.
    - CLI Options must be evaluated after CLI actions have been parsed.
    - Must be checked whether choosen distribution's package manager executable is present.
    - Functions return value implementation is more fast then "$()", but it is error prone, huge relay on unique variables names. Still do not want to split the file, it must be monolith.
